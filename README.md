**Task:** Create a DNA self-service login page/view and subscription listing.
 
**Tools:** Use your own computer to create the solution using any tools that you see fit for the task. Please be prepared to showcase the solution on your own laptop.
 
**Programming languages:** Use ~~either Angular,~~ React ~~or Vue framework, depending on which skills you want to showcase~~. All of these languages are currently in use at DNA.
 
**Functionality:** 
- The login page/view accepts an _user id_ (email) and _password_ and has a _submit button_. 
- The login should have checks for incorrect email-format and incorrect id/password. 
- The subscription page should list the customer subscriptions for example a few mobile subscriptions and a fixed broadband subscriptions. You can see some available DNA subscription based products on our web pages (https://www.dna.fi/puhe, https://kauppa4.dna.fi/nettimukaan and https://kauppa4.dna.fi/laajakaista). 
- You need to be able to click on the subscriptions to get details on the subscriptions (_user name_, _phone number_ for mobile and _address_ for broadband subscription, _subscription type_, _monthly price_). 
- The list should be _searchable_ either by subscription type by text or using facets. 
- After the search / facet choice the page should only show the relevant subsriptions. 
- The id/password and subscriptions can be hard coded. 
- Create test cases for the code.
 
**Additional requirements:**
- You should **not use any cli** that would generate the skeleton of the application (eg create-react-app, @vue/cli, etc). Instead you should** configure the application from scratch**.
- For web application it should also **support older browsers** at least to some degree. It can have some finer features missing but it should not break with older browsers. We will test it also on **IE11**.
 
**Design:** 

You can use the styles, pictures, logos etc. found on www.dna.fi site. For example the current login page for the self-service is located in minunpalveluni.dna.fi and if you want you can use it as a guide line. However you are not allowed to simple copy the code from there and use the same functionality (we will check this).
 
**Bonus tasks:**

• Create a back-end REST API that returns the items using Node.JS (or other technology).
• Make the pages responsive so that it resizes to desktop, tablet and mobile views.
• Write tests
 
_Note1:_ If you decide to do bonus tasks, we will value quality over quantity. Same goes if you feel that you are running out of time to complete the assignment. Instead of doing everything hastily, do the parts that you do well and leave additional stuff that you are unable to finish out. So robust and well commented code for a simple solution is better than an application with lot of functionality done with bad code.

_Note2:_ There will be additional task during the interview where you have to modify your solution on the spot. So make sure that your laptop has all of the required tools available for this.
 
Submit the task by 16.4.2019 either with email to juho.lehtinen@dna.fi or if you wish publish it in your github repository and send me the link.
